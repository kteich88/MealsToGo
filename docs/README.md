# Project Documentation

Hello & Welcome 👋

Broad explanations for features can be found in [application behavior](./application-behavior/).

The [architecture journal](./architecture-journal/) is the go to resource for learning about the architectural decisions that have been made for the project.

The [project architecture](./project-architecture/) outlines how to contribute, as well as the overall structure for our React Native Expo application.
